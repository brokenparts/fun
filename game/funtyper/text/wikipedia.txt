Wikipedia is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained 
by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open 
collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest 
and most-read reference work in history, and is consistently ranked 
among the ten most visited websites; as of December 2024, it was ranked 
fifth by Semrush, and seventh by Similarweb. Founded by Jimmy Wales and 
Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 
by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded 
mainly by donations from readers.
